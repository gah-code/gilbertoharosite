I would fill the pages with whimsical doodles, create comic books from stacks of folded paper, and experiment with different fonts, both by hand and through typography generators I found on AOL. This was all driven by my desire for creative expression. During the vibrant MySpace era, my interest in digital artistry blossomed, eventually leading me to pursue professional photography. This provided a whole new perspective for me in using creativity to build a career. </p><p>While searching for a more engaging outlet, I stumbled upon the electrifying world of web development. This discovery was nothing short of transformative; it became the perfect stage for my photography and opened doors to countless opportunities. I eagerly took on projects that allowed me to weave together all my diverse passions and skills. Today, as a Web Developer, I am thrilled to blend my appreciation for design patterns, my keen eye for color, my love for digital artistry, and my expertise in branding. These elements combine to create unique and meaningful digital experiences that resonate with others.</p><hr/><p><b>Inspiration Content</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCG2nuM3RFw\">Stanley Kubrick</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUt5gjqNI1w\">Aaron Swartz</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDZyOf6CW4&list=PL_82pxVXz6S27h01e0AnRoW3jvWIpkgcA\">Tony Fadell</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvLQJReDhic\">Composition In Storytelling</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXgFcNUWqX0\">Color In Storytelling</a></p></li><li><p>Whiplash vs. Black Swan â€” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba-CB6wVuvQ\">The Anatomy of the Obsessed Artist</a></p><p></p></li></ul><hr/><p><b>Music:</b></p><ul><li><p>French 79 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAv5pLO37mE\">Hometown</a></p></li><li><p>My Chemical Romance - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3df8CooYnSs\">This Is How I Disappear</a></p></li><li><p>Sublime - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxDO8PipeBw\">Garden Grove</a></p></li><li><p>Goddamn Electric Bill - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3T1GuwqOkI&list=PL_82pxVXz6S2a2m7L_xisTkUuwEjK5M-T&index=10\">Lost in the Zoo Remix</a> </p></li><li><p>working on it</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"3297f63a-c37f-52ea-8790-55f4a1d58e91","slug":"about","__params":{"slug":"about"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","header":"header"}}
